State Management: Provider

### State Management Explanation
This project uses Provider for managing app state such as articles, search filtering, and favorite toggling. The HomeViewModel class extends ChangeNotifier, exposing observable fields to the UI. Updates like toggling favorites or filtering articles through search automatically notify the UI to reflect changes.

### Persistence
Favorite articles are persisted using shared_preferences. When the user marks an article as favorite, its ID is stored locally, and the state is retained even after app restarts.
